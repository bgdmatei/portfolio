          <h1>Ronpa!</h1>
            <p> PROJECT OVERVIEW:

              Ronpa is a live debate platform designed to enable structured, live discussion of any issue. Unlike the multitude of text-based discussion platforms online, Ronpa brings people face to face.
              <hr>
              CONCEPT:
              The idea behind Ronpa was to create an approachable, fun way to debate live with strangers or people you know on a topic of your choosing. We wanted to take something that is perceived as intimidating and gamify it, in order to make it something that anyone could engage in, but without the pressure of a typical debate environment.

            <p> PROJECT OVERVIEW:
              Project Overview
              Swapsies is an app for those who are tired of getting peanuts for their unwanted games at second hand stores. Now you can swap them with other game enthusiasts and cut out the middleman.
              <hr>
              Concept
              Swapsies was created in order to give people a place to swap their old used games for new used games. It gives gamers an easy way to list their used games, and make requests to trade games from their inventory.
